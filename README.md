## Conclusion
In conclusion, the analysis showed company performance improvement in 2020 and reminded the company that it should be aware of the seasonality problem in the business.

The new products introduced in 2020 significantly dominated (90% of total revenue) the whole year's revenue. 
There are some products introduced in 2019 still showing significant improvement in 2020, indicating that products have growing potential. Company should clearly identify the main reason of old products with significant increases in 2020 for further actions, whether it is due to sales clearance with a lucrative discount or products in the introduction or growth stage in the product lifecycle. 

Besides, according to ABC analysis, there is a phenomenon that the number of products in category A (top 80% of sales) is increasing, meaning that more products are becoming profitable and important to company revenues. The average sales of the product increased from around 14,860,070 to 17,015,441, showing new product introduction decision is appropriate, resulting in the profitability of new products outperforming the traditional ones. The latest products not only drive company revenues but also diversify the risks creating synergy for the company.  

Furthermore, RFM analysis reveals the average purchase interval is shortened among customers, while the average frequency is tripled and the average purchase size is doubled. These are the signals of effective sales and marketing strategies that enhance customer engagement, and customer experience and unleash cross-selling and upselling opportunities. With the increase in purchase frequency and size, the company may need to adjust its inventory management and supply chain operation to meet the rising demands. 

However, under seasonality analysis, the company is unable to maintain a relatively consistent sales performance across the year. In 2019, there was a sudden rise in February achieving over 667 million sales, however, the months after could not maintain the performance and dropped significantly in March to 77 million and continued dropping with the lowest reach of 5.3 million in September. October has an obvious recovery to nearly 35 million sales. The trend keeps rising until June of the next year, reaching over 413 million sales but still far away from the peak. There is a clearer pattern in 2020, where the company better performed in the first half of the year. The common situation between 2 years is that after the company reached the highest sales in the year, the next month would be a dramatic drop in sales.  Further analysis is needed to understand the driver of flotation sales and the key to high sales achievement. Even though the new products introduced in 2020 already diversifying risks, driving a relatively stable environment, the company should consider other strategies to stabilise the fluctuation and seasonality problem, to achieve a more secure sales performance. The fluctuation will complexify inventory management with higher costs. 

Suggestions: 
1. **Conduct In-Depth Seasonal Analysis**: Initiate a comprehensive analysis to identify the underlying factors driving sales fluctuations. This should include examining customer behavior patterns, promotional impacts, and external factors (e.g., market trends, economic conditions). Understanding these drivers can help the company better prepare and strategise for seasonal peaks and troughs.

2. **Diversify Product Launch Timing**: Consider introducing new products throughout the year. This can help sustain interest and sales momentum, providing more consistent revenue streams and reducing dependence on seasonal spikes.

3. **Strengthen Marketing Strategies**: Enhance marketing campaigns during low sales periods to stimulate demand. This could involve targeted promotions, special discounts, or bundled product offerings that encourage customer purchases during off seasons.

4. **Explore Subscription Models**: Consider introducing subscription services for certain products, which can provide predictable and recurring revenue. This strategy can help stabilise cash flows and reduce the impact of seasonality on revenue.
